# Number Guessing Game
## About
In this project, a random number between 1 and 100 is generated using the random.randint() function. 
The player has a maximum number of attempts (max_attempts) to guess the correct number. 
The program prompts the player to enter their guess using the input() function and compares it with the secret number.

If the player's guess is lower than the secret number, the program displays "Too low!". 
If the guess is higher, it displays "Too high!". 
If the player guesses the correct number, it displays a congratulatory message and the number of attempts taken. 
The game ends in either of these cases.

If the player exhausts all their attempts without guessing the number correctly, the program displays a message indicating that the game is over and reveals the secret number.

### Additions
Feel free to modify the code to add additional features, such as allowing the player to choose the range of numbers or providing hints.
